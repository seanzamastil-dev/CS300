# CS300
Below contains code for a program that sorts classes, allowing for lookup that shows the prerequsities. 
What I feel I did well was small modular code that allows for rapid development, for instance I saw a bullitin post reminding us to watch out for alphebitcal sorting and deleting requisites that are invalid. It took me an hour and a half to develop modular code that worked with the program to fulfil these needs with the Abcu.txt debugging file. 
With more time, I could implement sorting that removes possible invalid lists and tells the user if a list was removed so that the file can be reorded to allow it to read properly. 
Development of this program helped me overcome large code to complete similar tasks, going from game development where users can abuse pixels for ingame exploits to something less nitpicky allows for easier to develop read and expand upon code.
Some of the roadblocks I dealt with is that I had previously taken this class and I was half way through with it, so when it was time to get back into it, I was a bit lost in terms of the semester until development started.
